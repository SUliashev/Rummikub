Notes on Boadsize:
number of chips possible on the board:
13 * 4 = 52
52 // 3 = 17	(maximum number of combinations)
17 * 3 = 51  (need about 3 spaces between 1 combination, so the dragging can work)

104 spaces are needed, make it 120 just to be sure(this does not yet include the horizontal spaces)

one chip has an approximate ratio of 1:2, so if monitor ratio is 9:16, 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:
create methods so that a chip is dragged into a field and stays there, if it is not dragged into an active field it returns to its original position
create sprites for all chips
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next steps: 
check what copilot created in the board logic and the new game logic file
start creating the logic for the game
-numbers in wrong order
-numbers with wrong colors
-numbers same numbers

create text for the game rules
- create multiple languages

work on the UI
