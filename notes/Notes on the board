Outline of how the classes should be working:
•board_interface: is responsible for drawing the current state of the game and interact with the chip_validator to see if the chips can be placed
•chip_generator: code to generate PNG images of all the chips that will be used within the game
•chip_tracker: keeps track of the current state of the game, where each chip is located
•chip_validator: checks whether the desired placement of a chip is valid by keeping separate track of the chips()
•chip: class for the actual data of one specific chip. Keeps track of its color, number and location
•game_controler: is responsible for the interaction between the classes
•main: excecution of the game
•tray: keeps track of the players current chips

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working on now:
added a new class which only validates the chips, if the validation is correct, the chip can be placed into the slot and the chip_tracker will be updated with the current state of the game
- the classes have been changed completely once more, fix all issues so that the game returns to the previous testing stage

the dragging of the chip towards a slot, if the slot is not empty, the chip should be returned to its original position

game logic, getting a combination of chips
--chips are currently marked in the slot before they are snapped to it, i believe



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:
-create methods so that a chip is dragged into a field and stays there, if it is not dragged into an active field it returns to its original position
-create sprites for all chips
-when the chip is removed from the slot, the slot is not being set to None
-For the shown lines, if a chip is hovered over a rectangle, the rectange becomes larger
-improve the selecting of the next slot, right now its not very intuitive

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next steps: 

start creating the logic for the game
-numbers in wrong order
-numbers with wrong colors
-numbers same numbers

create text for the game rules
- create multiple languages

work on the UI
