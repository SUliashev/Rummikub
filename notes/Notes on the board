------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:
create methods so that a chip is dragged into a field and stays there, if it is not dragged into an active field it returns to its original position
create sprites for all chips
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working on now:
game logic, getting a combination of chips
--chips are currently marked in the slot before they are snapped to it, i believe




------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next steps: 
-imporove the drag to slot method, it seems to not always work


start creating the logic for the game
-numbers in wrong order
-numbers with wrong colors
-numbers same numbers

create text for the game rules
- create multiple languages

work on the UI
