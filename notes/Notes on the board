Outline of how the classes should be working:
•board_interface: is responsible for drawing the current state of the game and interact with the chip_validator to see if the chips can be placed
•chip_generator: code to generate PNG images of all the chips that will be used within the game
•chip_tracker: keeps track of the current state of the game, where each chip is located
•chip_validator: checks whether the desired placement of a chip is valid. the chip_tracker class goes through this one
•chip: class for the actual data of one specific chip. Keeps track of its color, number and location
•game_controler: is responsible for the interaction between the classes
•main: excecution of the game
•tray: keeps track of the players current chips

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working on now:



redo the storing of data for chips
-chip coordinates should be stored in the chip Tracker, this should also hold the row and col of the chip, these in turn update the chip x and y, and these are shown on the board

return to tray origin is not working, it is currently being returned to the board


-implement 2 players

-make it so that chips are moved when trying to place them into the tray









------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next steps: 
select multiple chips




-create rules for the joker
-create player changes

create text for the game rules
- create multiple languages

work on the UI


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done V2: 

Done V1:


-create methods so that a chip is dragged into a field and stays there, if it is not dragged into an active field it returns to its original position
-create sprites for all chips
-when the chip is removed from the slot, the slot is not being set to None
-For the shown lines, if a chip is hovered over a rectangle, the rectange becomes larger
-improve the selecting of the next slot, right now its not very intuitive
-updating the chip_validator so that it validates the chips based on the hovering chip and the chip_tracker. The chip tracker will be updated via the validator, instead of both keeping track on the state of the game and separately being updated in the game controller 
-fix chip validation so that it shows red if the move is not valid
-create the tray which will hold the players chips
-the dragging of the chip towards a slot, if the slot is not empty, the chip should be returned to its original position
