To do:

some sort of bug is happening with the validation when the joker is in play, combination [J, b11, b13] shows as valid

player should not be able to place a chip if the move is not valid, chip should be returned

add button which sorts the chips in the tray 

button for undo move

button for undoing all the moves the player has made

select multiple chips and drag them 

to adjust the sprite generator

add a method that shifts the chips to the left or right if a hovering chip wants to be placed there, also for the chips to return if the chip is then moved

add chips visibly being moved around the board when returning and being drawn (in gameUI)

add menu 



Some explanation on the classes: 

board_grid: stores xy coordinates of slot locations and the item within slot
sprite_generation: creates images of all the chips 
chip_tracker : contains tray_grids, board_grids and dragging_chip and handles their interaction
chip_validator : checks whether chip combinations are valid based on the values in the chip_tracker
chip: class for the chip itself, holds image, color and number (can be a joker)
config: holds data on the sizes of the object(buttons, chips, window width, ect.), uppon starting, it creates sizes of everyting based on the resolution of the window
dragging_chip: chip that is being moved by a player around the window
game_controller: connects the chip_tracker , chip_validator, player_interaction and the gameUI
gameUI: renders the current state of the game based on the chip_tracker
player_interaction: checks the events and pushes the needed actions to ChipTracker and gameUI
players: creates players on startup which have their own name and own tray_grid
tray_grid: holds chips and chip coordinates for individual players
