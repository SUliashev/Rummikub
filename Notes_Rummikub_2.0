improve code









Some explanation on the classes: 

board_grid: stores xy coordinates of slot locations and the item within slot
sprite_generation: creates images of all the chips 
chip_tracker : contains tray_grids, board_grids and dragging_chip and handles their interaction
chip_validator : checks whether chip combinations are valid based on the values in the chip_tracker
chip: class for the chip itself, holds image, color and number (can be a joker)
config: holds data on the sizes of the object(buttons, chips, window width, ect.), uppon starting, it creates sizes of everyting based on the resolution of the window
dragging_chip: chip that is being moved by a player around the window
game_controller: connects the chip_tracker , chip_validator, player_interaction and the gameUI
gameUI: renders the current state of the game based on the chip_tracker
player_interaction: checks the events and pushes the needed actions to ChipTracker and gameUI
players: creates players on startup which have their own name and own tray_grid
tray_grid: holds chips and chip coordinates for individual players
