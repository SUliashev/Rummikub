To do:


for undoing all moves, need to keep track of the draw chip, if all moves are returned, make sure the chip is placed in the first available slot
    can actualy add this to move history, if the action is chip drawn, the move is skiped and deleted 

to check if the current_move_chips_drawn is correctly with the moves and returns

add rules for the game:
    first turn needs to have 30 points total
    one chip can be drawn, otherwise next player turn

    chips cannot placed from board to tray if they were not in the players current move
    chips can be placed back to tray if player placed them in the current move
    each player gets 14 chips from start
    sort grid only available after a few turns
    to add a message terminal for the player of the errors:
        invalid move
        sort chips after 3 turns
        cannot take chips from board
        cannot proceed to next move as the combinations on the board are invalid


to adjust the sprite generator

can work a bit on the warning window

add menu with selection of the player amount



Notes for improvement:
i did not manage to make the dragging chip be drawn via event of mouse movement, the drawing of it was called prior to the board being drawn, thus I could not draw it correctly
Ended up dispatching the x and y coordinates or the mouse to the chiptracker, the moving chip is then drawn based on those coordinates


Some explanation on the classes: 

board_grid: stores xy coordinates of slot locations and the item within slot
sprite_generation: creates images of all the chips 
chip_tracker : contains tray_grids, board_grids and dragging_chip and handles their interaction
chip_validator : checks whether chip combinations are valid based on the values in the chip_tracker
chip: class for the chip itself, holds image, color and number (can be a joker)
config: holds data on the sizes of the object(buttons, chips, window width, ect.), uppon starting, it creates sizes of everyting based on the resolution of the window
dragging_chip: chip that is being moved by a player around the window
game_controller: connects the chip_tracker , chip_validator, player_interaction and the gameUI
gameUI: renders the current state of the game based on the chip_tracker
player_interaction: checks the events and pushes the needed actions to ChipTracker and gameUI
players: creates players on startup which have their own name and own tray_grid
tray_grid: holds chips and chip coordinates for individual players
